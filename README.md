# Learning-Hyperledger
Storing work and samples created as I learn go, lynix, and hyperledger.
I am a 71 year old business consultant with some experience programming ROM Basic and Dbase 2 many years ago.  I have helped create large systems, but I have been the business process guru and was able to explain what the output should look like. This project is different becasue there are fewer peopel with whom I can work to facilitate my ideas.
